    "subtitle": "3rd International Conference on Big Data, IoT and Machine Learning (BIM 2025)",
    "description": "This research presents a lightweight data mining methodology designed to detect fraudulent reviews by integrating both textual content analysis and user behavioral patterns[cite: 1, 8, 9]. Presented at the 3rd International Conference on Big Data, IoT and Machine Learning in Dhaka, Bangladesh.",
    "story": "This project addressed the growing challenge of trust in digital marketplaces. By combining how a review is written with how a user behaves, we created a more robust detection system that doesn't require massive computational resources.",
