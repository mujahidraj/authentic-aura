    "subtitle": "ACL Workshop on South and Southeast Asian NLP (2021)",
    "description": "We introduce BengaliSent, a manually annotated corpus of 120,000 social media posts for three-class sentiment classification. We fine-tune multilingual BERT and XLM-RoBERTa and achieve state-of-the-art F1 of 91.3%, outperforming prior work by 8.2 points.",
    "story": "This paper grew out of frustration at how little NLP tooling existed for Bengali speakers. What started as a side project became a published benchmark that other researchers continue to build on.",
